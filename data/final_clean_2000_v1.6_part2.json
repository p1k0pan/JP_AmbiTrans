It could mean the frisbee is placed over the boy's face, or it could be a more metaphorical or playful way of saying the frisbee is near his face, such as being held up to his face. The ambiguity also arises because it is unclear whether the frisbee is literally worn as a face covering or if it is a metaphorical or humorous description of something else (e.g., a hat or a mask shaped like a frisbee).",
